OpenDendro features the comprehensive set of tools of the [Dendrochronology Program Library (`dpl`) (Holmes 1983)](https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/pub/dpl-mac/68k/dpl.txt){target=_blank} created by Richard Holmes, a research software engineer at the University of Arizona's [Laboratory of Tree Ring Research](https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/pub/dpl/index.html){target=_blank} who harnessed the quantitative potential of dendrochronology in the 1980s and early-1990s. 

OpenDendro offers equivalent functionality of `dpl` through the [`dplpy`](python.md) library for Python and [`dplR`](r.md) library for R. 

These libraries also incorporate various tools found in Ed Cook's [ARSTAN program suite](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/dendrosoftware/){target=_blank}. 

Cook's groundbreaking work in the development and maintenance of ARSTAN has been instrumental in propelling dendrochronology forward, and without it, progress in the field would have been significantly hindered.

+ [dplPy](python.md)
+ [dplR](r.md)

To facilitate accessibility, we have made the source code of ARSTAN and other programs written in the FORTRAN programming language available for interested researchers. 

+ [FORTRAN](fortran.md)

Additionally, we have developed a selection of user-friendly 
[Apps](apps.md) for tree-ring analysis, which are based on the `dplR` library. These apps provide a more streamlined experience for specific applications within dendrochronology.
